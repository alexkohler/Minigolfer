6-23: initializing project. Running into problems getting theme to work. Need to spec out what you want UI to look like BEFORE you dive into it.

6-24: Fleshing out tableview for new game 

7-1: Added horizontal scrollview, desired support is working without having to change much.

TODO:
need to look into adding vertical scrollview - test harder

remove scrollview margins

you want a sticky first hole column (separate tableview likely should do the trick

need to figure out how to add additional players

you also need a way to easily add/remove players after an initial number is 
already given(people make mistakes and this makes your app more robust)

push to open golf ball choice under each player's name


mess with styles.xml to get golf card workig properly 
make sure your card is editable and pretty. (fixed size, scrollable, etc)
your view card is exclusively tables, aye aye claptain 
Probably need to use themes intead of programatic colors
