6-23: initializing project. Running into problems getting theme to work. Need to spec out what you want UI to look like BEFORE you dive into it.

6-24: Fleshing out tableview for new game 

7-1: Added horizontal scrollview, desired support is working without having to change much.

7-7: Added holes, need to get add button up and running. that is definitely the priority right now

7-8: got basics of button added, just need to add on click listener and place the button properly :)

7-19: need to think of more robust way to add/remove rows programatically, manually naming each is gonna make you have a bad time when you start adding/removing rows
programmatically add column - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13472393/add-column-to-table-programmatically

7-22: get rest of delete buttons, and make sure they're white (or add them in another way)

7-26: need to use viewgroup to group edittext and divider http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367983/how-to-use-viewgroup-in-android - perhaps a horizontal linearlayout or something

8-2: finished add/remove functionality, and summing of rows. 


TODO:

remove scrollview margins if add button stuff doesn't take care of it automatically

you want a sticky first hole column (separate tableview likely should do the trick
