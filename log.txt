6-23: initializing project. Running into problems getting theme to work. Need to spec out what you want UI to look like BEFORE you dive into it.

6-24: Fleshing out tableview for new game 

7-1: Added horizontal scrollview, desired support is working without having to change much.

7-7: Added holes, need to get add button up and running. that is definitely the priority right now

7-8: got basics of button added, just need to add on click listener and place the button properly :)

7-19: need to think of more robust way to add/remove rows programatically, manually naming each is gonna make you have a bad time when you start adding/removing rows
programmatically add column - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13472393/add-column-to-table-programmatically

7-22: get rest of delete buttons, and make sure they're white (or add them in another way)

7-26: need to use viewgroup to group edittext and divider http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367983/how-to-use-viewgroup-in-android - perhaps a horizontal linearlayout or something

8-2: finished add/remove functionality, and summing of rows. 
Add floating button dependency - https://github.com/futuresimple/android-floating-action-button 
8-17: lots of various changes

8-18: got player and playerDAO and basics of DBHelper set up, next up is to actually run on device and use to save/release data. After that your previous_games table needs to go up, along with a prevGame object and DAO

8-19: got current game database stuff hooked up and working pretty well. 

8-20: fixed name updates, added finish button and sticky first column
