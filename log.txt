6-23: initializing project. Running into problems getting theme to work. Need to spec out what you want UI to look like BEFORE you dive into it.

6-24: Fleshing out tableview for new game 

7-1: Added horizontal scrollview, desired support is working without having to change much.

7-7: Added holes, need to get add button up and running. that is definitely the priority right now

7-8: got basics of button added, just need to add on click listener and place the button properly :)

7-19: need to think of more robust way to add/remove rows programatically, manually naming each is gonna make you have a bad time when you start adding/removing rows
programmatically add column - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13472393/add-column-to-table-programmatically

7-22: get rest of delete buttons, and make sure they're white (or add them in another way)

7-26: need to use viewgroup to group edittext and divider http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367983/how-to-use-viewgroup-in-android - perhaps a horizontal linearlayout or something

8-2: finished add/remove functionality, and summing of rows. 
Add floating button dependency - https://github.com/futuresimple/android-floating-action-button 

TODO:

figure out this instance saving nonsense 
	If user goes to another page, onPause is called, you will need to save the data to a CURRENT_GAME SQLite database
	While on the page of SQL, you will need a means of remembering previous games as well
	Need to spec out CURRENT_GAME database
		Simply table with max amount of players? Should this be fixed?
	Yes, max players should be 10.

prompt user on opening of how many players they wish to play with?
	I think this will be dependent on the CURRENT_GAME database
	This functionality definitely needed, as manually adding players will be annoying


you want a sticky first hole column (separate tableview likely should do the trick

push to open golf ball choice under each player's name
	Different orientation quickaction depending on screen orientation?
	imageview might want to go next to Name edittext?
