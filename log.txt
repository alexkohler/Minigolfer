6-23: initializing project. Running into problems getting theme to work. Need to spec out what you want UI to look like BEFORE you dive into it.

6-24: Fleshing out tableview for new game 

7-1: Added horizontal scrollview, desired support is working without having to change much.

7-7: Added holes, need to get add button up and running. that is definitely the priority right now

7-8: got basics of button added, just need to add on click listener and place the button properly :)

7-19: need to think of more robust way to add/remove rows programatically, manually naming each is gonna make you have a bad time when you start adding/removing rows
programmatically add column - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13472393/add-column-to-table-programmatically

7-22: get rest of delete buttons, and make sure they're white (or add them in another way)

7-26: need to use viewgroup to group edittext and divider http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367983/how-to-use-viewgroup-in-android - perhaps a horizontal linearlayout or something


TODO:
Spec: floating button with add/remove player, and trash game? Additional settings can go to the top of the action bar

need to figure out how to add additional players (both UI placement and back end)

remove scrollview margins if add button stuff doesn't take care of it automatically

you want a sticky first hole column (separate tableview likely should do the trick


you also need a way to easily add/remove players after an initial number is 
already given(people make mistakes and this makes your app more robust)

push to open golf ball choice under each player's name


mess with styles.xml to get golf card workig properly 
make sure your card is editable and pretty. (fixed size, scrollable, etc)
your view card is exclusively tables, aye aye claptain 
Probably need to use themes intead of programatic colors
